# HelloAlexa

Was implementing some wakeword capabilities with Aanyang, and analysing the stream of audio to automatically stop recording. Temporarily removed these capabilities- against Alexa's Terms of Service. Theoretically, this could function as an open web Alexa client that could be left running in a browser, waiting for a query, identical to the Echo.
